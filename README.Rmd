# Purpose of TheoChemR

[![CRAN version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/TheoChemR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TheoChemR)
![cranlogs](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org./badges/TheoChemR)

The TheoChemR package provides a collection of useful functions
when working with output from quantum chemical calculations, mainly provided
by Gaussian and to a lesser extend by ORCA. The main idea is to read in
important sections of the output file for further processing and analysis in R.
